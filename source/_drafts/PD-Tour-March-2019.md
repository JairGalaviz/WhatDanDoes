I was called to serve as a Wycliffe Bible Translator a little over a year ago. My Wycliffe story began when a missionary visited my church, Saint Peter's Lutheran in Cochrane. We talked after service over coffee. By the time we parted ways, I already knew my time would be best spent translating the Bible.

At the time, I made my living teaching Web Development and pursuing entrepreneurial endeavours. My academic background consists of Bachelor's and Masters degrees in Computer Science and a Master of Divinity from Ambrose Seminary. I also boast a vocational diploma in Radio & Television Broadcasing.

I became a Christian at the age of 25. God called me to serve his church two years later. I consider that my first _major_ call. I've been called to serve in many capacities since then. A call to graduate school is among them. All were _minor_ in comparison to the second major call on my life: translating the Bible into every language.

Christ called us all to carry out his Great Commission... telling the story of His life, death, and resurrection to everyone in the world. I am not unique in this calling, though I am uniquely qualified to serve in a certain way. I became a Web Developer immediately upon finishing my graduate research in the field of Artificial Intelligence. A Web Developer is a specialized computer programmer. In general, programmers write software for computers. Web Developers write software for delivery over the World Wide Web.

Wycliffe and SIL International have many programmers and a large catalog of software, fonts, and keyboards. Software for Bible translation and evangelism. Fonts and keyboards in minority languages for literacy... basic tools for recording peoples stories and writing new ones. Introducing literacy to people whose languages often cannot be written down requires a tremendous world-wide coordinated effort. Given that many of these minority language groups are often very small, they are easily overlooked by the wider world. Our mission is the Great Commission... introducing literacy is required for the job. Literacy brings with it education, economy, and equality. These people are empowered to record their stories, preserve their cultures, and through the power of the God's Word, write their new stories in eternity.

Corrupted English? All languages are equally capable of expressing God's truth.
