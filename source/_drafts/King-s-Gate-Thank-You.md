title: King's Gate Thank You
tags:

My name is Daniel Bidulock, emissary from Saint Peter's Lutheran. Your congregation recently gave us reason to give thanks to God. In turn, my church council gave me the privilege of coming to you folk at King's Gate to say _Thank you_ for your generous gift.

Beyond material provision, your generosity has given us at Saint Pete's reason for self-reflection and prayer. You've  blessed us with the question of how to appropriately give thanks to God and how to best show our appreciation to you. This is a wonderful opportunity to build friendship, fellowship, and God's kingdom.

As a Wycliffe Bible Translator, I depend on generosity to do my work. Through my prayer and financial partners, I get to witness first hand how generosity builds God's kingdom. It is a powerful force. What a wonderful thing you've done! Joyful givers giving in faithful obedience trusting God that their giving will change lives... will change the world.

I wonder how your generosity will change Saint Pete's. How will your generosity change the world?

Let me pray...

God, praise you for your children at King's Gate. Let Saint Peter's seek your will in how to best give thanks and how to best invest what we've been given. Please bless this congregation with good health, good spirits, and may your abudnance always outpace their generosity. In your Son's name, amen.

Thank you, and merry Christmas from me, my family, and Saint Peter's Lutheran.
