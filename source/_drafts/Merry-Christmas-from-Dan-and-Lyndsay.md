## Merry Christmas!

Christmas came to our house early this year. As a new missionary family, the love and generosity celebrated as part of the season is part of our everyday reality. Without love and generosity, I could not do my work as a Wycliffe Bible Translator. Card-writing and gift-giving in recognition of our supporters is a joy we had not known before. Finding new ways to express appreciation is a worthwhile and joyous exercise sure to invite the Christmas Spirit.

### Listen to my sermon on the Christmas Spirit on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rwpV4CtgXBA).

This sermon was written for a local aboriginal radio station and read with a special family in my heart and prayers. May God's truth ring out true and clear for you. [Read the full text here](https://whatdandoes.info/2018/12/12/Galatians-5-13-26-Living-by-the-Spirit-s-Power/).


## Missionary Highlights

{% asset_img wycliffe-at-50.jpg Wycliffe's 50th Anniversary in Canada %}

I was made a Wycliffe member in May, just in time to celebrate Wycliffe's 50th anniversary in Canada. I left my old job to follow my call full time in November. Though I miss being surrounded by people who speak the languages of computers, it's been wonderful to turn my focus from machines to serving God's people at home and all around the world. 

Over the year, the most memorable opportunities Wycliffe brought involved preaching and speaking. Apart from churches, I was called to speak to a Vacation Bible School class and was allowed to share my testimony at my church's national conference. All this to promote my work and build my support base.

If you are in the Cochrane area, come to [Saint Peter's Lutheran](http://saintpeters.ca/) on December 30th to hear me preach for the final time this year.

## There's an Immediate Need at Wycliffe

Computing has revolutionized all aspects of our life. Bible translation is no exception. As a Web developer at Wycliffe, I will write and deliver [software used in translation](https://scriptureforge.org/) over the World Wide Web. Web applications are the most immediate and convenient way to enable access to software and Scriptures to people all over the world.

Wycliffe needs me to teach other developers how to write software for the Web. The need is urgent. I cannot start work until the budget set for me by Wycliffe has been filled.

## Partnership with my Ministry

Thanks to our partners, we have raised roughly $13,000. This money will sustain my family and enable me to continue building my financial support base full-time through January. We are grateful for the responsibility and for the people God has prepared to join us in this work.

All faithful believers understand that the Great Commission is of primary importance in building God's Kingdom and spreading Christmas around the globe.

Read about how [a confiscated cellphone](https://whatdandoes.info/2018/12/03/Jesus-Speaks-through-an-App/) lead to imigration officials hearing the Scriptures in their own language for the first time. Or how [Scripture delivered over the World Wide Web](https://whatdandoes.info/2018/12/05/The-Bible-on-the-Web-God-s-GPS/) allows people unprecedented access to God's life-changing wisdom.

All faithful believers understand that _generosity_ is at the heart of Christmas and how the Good News is delivered to the world.

With your generosity, every box will contain an **X** and I'll be able to start work in February.
