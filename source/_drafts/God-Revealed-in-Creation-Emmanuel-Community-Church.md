Preaching is Bible translation. It's retelling stories in a way that speaks to the heart. Proclaiming the truth of your salvation in Christ.

It's not easy to understand. Sometimes the heart and mind are hard, infertile ground. For those whose hearts and minds provide rich soil, Sunday's sermons become a reminder that our sins are forgiven and that our lives in eternity belong to God.

This is the story of creation as told in the first four verses of the Bible. This is where everything begins.

# Genesis 1:1-4 (KJV)

> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
>
> <sup>2</sup> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
>
> <sup>3</sup> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
>
> <sup>4</sup> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

The first sentence in the Bible plainly states that God created the world we know. Whatever existed before our universe had no form. It was empty. It's there, but you can't see through its own deep darkness. This is what God holds in his hands. His Spirit spreads over what is here described as _the waters_.

By His Word and His Spirit, God imposes his order over the formless mass by speaking light into it. Looking at what He has now, God likes what he sees. It is good. He separates light from what was once only shapeless darkness.

## Reflection

Of the English translations I've read, I think the King James Version of the Bible tells this story the best. It speaks closest to my heart and it appeals to my mind, because I recognize the truth in it. Let me share the story of creation through the eyes of a Computer Scientist.

Few people appreciate the philosophical foundations of Computer Science. Even myself, I best understand it as a computer programmer wielding a mode of self expression. Computer programming allows me to create with a machine. I speak the languages of machines.

Few people understand how Computer Science is even _science_. It is unique in that the scientific method is embodied entirely in the computer program, written in the language of machines. Hypothesis, observation, and proof are all wrapped up in the program. The _science_ of Computer Science is carried out when we prove a problem can be solved by a machine... the problem is _computable_.

For most people, the apps on our phones and laptops are where it begins and ends. But when you start asking the question of which problems are computable, new questions about reality, randomness, and life bubble to the surface. In seeking answers to these questions, you may conclude that what is impossible for a machine, is also impossible in the world in which we live and breath.

If held to be true, this is an incredible revelation. It provides us a new way to express God's truth. It reveals God, and reveals His image in us. We create with our words. We create like God.

But it's even more incredible than that...

When I write a program, I write it so that _people_ can understand it. Computers don't use words like we do. The words I write in a program are translated into electrical charges usually stored on disk. Inside the computer we find billions of tiny transistors. If there is a high voltage on one transistor we symbolize it with a 1. If there is a low voltage, we symbolize it with a 0. Human language gets interpreted into 1s and 0s, and then ultimately into electrical magnetic charges on billions of transistors on a silicon chip. This is _digital electronics_. The 1s and 0s are the digits we chose to represent the electrical charges. From human-readable code, to 1s and 0s. This is how the machine does what I tell it to do.

Computer Science is carried out when we solve a problem with a program.

Can I solve a problem in this way? When it comes to Bible translation, the answer is definitely _yes_. God gave me the gifts to observe, hypothesize, and prove. This is why I am called to serve with Wycliffe.

Think of what can be expressed with 1s and 0s. Lightness and darkness.

Every story ever told or will ever be told. We read stories on a computer. We stream movies from Netflix. All are expressed with 1s and 0s.

Where do we see evidence of God's creative hand in all this? We see it in ourselves. We also see it in infinity. A secular Computer Scientist knows that nothing is random and that nothing in this universe is infinite. A Christian knows that God is infinite and our universe is in his hand.

Apart from God, when I think infinite, my mind drifts to the number Pi. When you try to calculate it, you find that it meandres _randomly_ forever. Even more curious, there's no discernable pattern in the sequence of numbers that depict Pi. We use computers to calculate Pi to trillions of decimal points. No repetition yet.

Pi, of course, when calculated by a computer is first expressed in 1s and 0s. Just like a computer program. Just like your favourite novel.

Pi, remember, is infinite. It also has no discernable order. It never repeats. Somewhere in the digits that express Pi, there is a sequence of 1s and 0s, that if given to a computer, will execute a program. Not only that, every slight variant of that program is also encoded somewhere in the digits that form Pi. It could be a simple program that says _Hello, world!_, or it might be Super Mario. It's all there somewhere in the _formless waters_ of Pi. This is what becomes possible in the face of the infinite. Even if we took every disk on earth, we'd never be able to contain Pi. Even if we somehow used every atom in the universe to create a disk, we would never be able to contain Pi.

We create with our words, but we are not God. Only God can separate light from dark, day from night, water from sky, land from water, and create plants, animals, and people all with stories of their own. Our God-_like_ creative capacity is nothing compared to that of God himself. Jesus, the Word made flesh, gave us the greatest story ever told. When faced with the reality of infinity we only begin to understand how God can write a good story for everyone. Some people have sad stories, but Christ the Word, our Author, our Creator, our Programmer, makes a sad story a good story. When faced with infinity, we suddenly realize how all people can be redeemed, how all people can be forgiven their sins, and how all people can have their good stories told in eternity.

That was creation viewed through the lens of Computer Science. Let the story speak to your heart and mind. May God guide your hand in expressing your God-given creativity to write a good story.
