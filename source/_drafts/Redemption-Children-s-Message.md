# Saint Peter's Lutheran - First Sunday in Christmas

## What is Redemption?

- Have you ever broken something?

- Was someone upset?

### Derek and the Van Window

My friend Derek was playing baseball at church and he put a ball through the back window of the van.

- Do you think someone was upset?

- How might Derek make things better?

Derek paid $300 to have the windshield replaced.

- Is it all better now?

We might say Derek _redeemed_ the situation.

### 

- Do you think someone was upset?

- How might _ ______  make things better?

He can't. There is nothing he can do to redeem the situation.

### What does redemption have to do with Christmas?

- Do you ever do things to make Jesus upset?
- How can you make it better?

You can't. When you do something that makes Jesus upset, we call that sin. We are all sinners and there's nothing we can do to change this.

- Does that make you upset?

Well, I've got Good News. God wants us all to be redeemed. He came at Christmas as the baby Jesus so that he could one day redeem us.

- How do you think he did this?
- How much do you think it cost?

God gave us an incredible gift at Christmas. He gave us Himself. He is the baby Jesus. One day he would pay the ultimate price for our redemption. 

### Maybe we can do something...

What if _ ______ forgave Derek for breaking _ ______?

- Do you think that would make things better?

_ ______ might just be able to redeem the situation.

- How would Jesus redeem us when we sin?

From the Bible in the Book of Colossions 3:12-13

> As Godâ€™s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord[f] has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 


## Prayer

Father God, thank you for sending your son Jesus to be our redeemer. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for choosing us. Please teach us compassion, kindness, and patience. Let us forgive each other, just like you forgave us. In Jesus name, amen.
You are God's chosen ones.
