# Saint Peter's Lutheran - First Sunday in Christmas

## Exodus 13:1-3a, 11-15

The Israelite's, led by Moses, have just left Egypt in the middle of a national tragedy. The lives of every firstborn animal and every firstborn Egyptian were taken by God in the night. It was this event that finally coerced Pharaoh into allowing the Israelite slaves to worship God in the desert without their Egyptian overseers. Having discovered their children dead in the middle of the night, <!-- more --> both Pharaoh and the Egyptian people urge the Israelite's to leave immediately. Moses provided the Israelites with precise instructions on how to prepare for this event. In part, they were to eat a lamb with their staffs in hand, ready to leave on a moment's notice. The blood of the lamb they consume is applied to the door frame so that God would pass over their houses and the lives of their firstborn would be spared. God further supplied the Israelite exodus by granting them favour in the eyes of their Egyptian neighbours. When asked by the Israelites, the Egyptians were generous in giving jewelry, gold, silver, and clothing in order to hasten their departure. Apart from God's favour, the Egyptians feared more of their people would die if the Israelites lingered any longer.

This event became known as the _Passover_, because God _passed over_ the firstborn of Israel.

Today's Old Testament lesson opens with God instructing Moses in the aftermath of the first Passover. God tells Moses that the firstborn male of every animal and every Israelite belongs to him. God commands they be consecrated, or set apart for him.

Moses, relays God's instruction to Israel. They are to remember the day God set them free from slavery in Egypt. They are to remember how they prepared to leave the moment the opportunity arose. Moses marks this as a day of remembrance set apart to give glory to God and to celebrate his strength in subduing Pharoah. Moses tells Israel to mark the occasion with a week-long time of worship called the _Festival of Unleavened Bread_. Passover is only one day. The festival that follows is seven days. Leaven, or yeast, isn't even allowed in the house during this time of celebration. In the desert, Israel had eaten bread made from dough they brought out of Egypt. It was unleavened because they were being driven out and could not wait <sup>[Exodus 12:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12%3A39&version=NRSV)</sup>. At minimum, the prohibition on leaven serves as a reminder and teaching tool for future generations.

Though the Israelites had left Egypt, they had not yet entered the land God promised to them. What we read in this lesson happens before Moses parts the Red Sea while being pursued by Pharaoh. Moses tells the Israelites that when God gives them the promised land of Canaan, they are to set aside their firstborn males for him. Not only the firstborn of their livestock, but their firstborn sons as well. These animals and people belong to God. The animals are to be sacrificed, with one exception... donkeys may be purchased back from God by sacrificing a sheep instead. If you do not redeem the donkey, you must break its neck. There are all sorts of ideas as to why the non-kosher donkey has this special status. Firstborn baby boys must be redeemed or presumably be dedicated to serve in the temple. 

Moses tells the Israelites how to instruct their children when they ask us why the firstborn are set apart in this way. They are to tell their children that they were once slaves in Egypt. They left Egypt by God's strength. Because of Pharaoh's stubborness, God killed all the firstborn animals and the firstborn Egyptian sons. In remembrance of this, the Israelites sacrifice all the firstborn of their own flocks. In remembrance of this, they purchase freedom for their firstborn sons.

The Israelites are to celebrate this event and tell the story to their children. God freed Israel from Egypt. Their very existence as nation unto themselves is proof of God's strength.

### Reflection

Seeing as how I'm a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://wycliffe.ca), I don't suspect that anyone would be surprised that I read the Bible every day. This year I completed my eleventh pass from Genesis to Revelation. Starting January 1st, I read four chapters every day. At this rate, in a regular non-leap year, I finish on October 24th. From there, I do a second pass of the New Testament. I finish on December 28th, which gives me a few days to choose a translation to start reading on New Year's Day. No matter how many times I read it, the story of Israel is frustrating. As an outsider with the benefit of Scripture and being able to worship Christ for his sacrifice, it's astounding how quickly the Israelites forget all that they have seen. These are God's own chosen people, and they routinely break their commitments to God. Several times throughout their early history, they even look back to the security they knew in slavery rather than trusting God to provide for their needs.

In today's Old Testament lesson, we find the Israelites at a defining moment in their history as a sovereign nation. Having just celebrated the first Passover, God instructs them to start planning a celebration: the Festival of Unleavened Bread. All this so that Israel remembers what happened. All this so that their children will ask what it all means. God commands Israel to celebrate this way every year. He then reminds the people of his promise of a homeland and delivers some day-to-day instruction for when they get there. He says the firstborn sons of all people and animals belong to Him. This is to constantly remind Israel of the awesome power demonstrated by God during the first Passover. Israel owe their lives to God. 

The themes of freedom, truth, celebration, promise, and the fear of God flow through this lesson.

## Psalm 111

Likewise, we see these themes in our other Old Testament lesson, Psalm 111. They are captured in the final two verses:

> He sent redemption to his people;
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has commanded his covenant forever.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy and awesome is his name.

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
>
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those who practice it have a good understanding.
>
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His praise endures forever.

God redeemed his people. Israel owes their freedom to Him. Know this and know _The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom_. Obey God and live by the covenant he made. Seek His will in all matters and be wise. Know that what God says is true. Worship Him. 


## Luke 2:22-40

By God's design, the Passover was an extraordinarily public event. Visible to everyone. The birth of Jesus Christ also took place in the public eye so that witnesses would remember God's promises. From the opening of the chapter, Luke tells of Joseph and Mary being compelled by the government of the time to be counted in a census. And he tells of shepherds being visited by angels who announce the child's birth.

The angels say,

> “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”
>
> [Luke 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A14&version=NRSV)

Upon hearing this, the shepherds rush into Bethlehem to see the child for themselves.

Eight days after he is born, the child is named Jesus and circumcised in accordance with the Law. Today's Gospel lesson opens with Joseph and Mary being compelled by the laws God handed down through Moses. They came to the temple to redeem Mary's firstborn son and for Mary's own ritual purification after childbirth. They offer a sacrifice so that she may be readmitted to the temple for worship. Luke says the offering consisted of two pigeons or two turtledoves, which suggests they could not afford a lamb. This is all in accordance with the law described in [Leviticus 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+12&version=NRSV). The priest would have made atonement for Mary and declared her ritually cleansed. She was then allowed to return to worship.

Luke then tells of a man named Simeon who lived in Jerusalem. He describes him as righteous, devout, and looking forward to Jerusalem receiving the Messiah. The Holy Spirit rested upon him. The Spirit had, in fact, told Simeon that he would not die until he met the Messiah. When Christ was born, the Spirit led Simeon to Mary and Joseph in the temple.

When Mary allowed Simeon to hold her baby, he praises God saying,

> <sup>29</sup> “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to your word;
>
> <sup>30</sup> for my eyes have seen your salvation,
>
> <sup>31</sup>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
>
> <sup>32</sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for glory to your people Israel.”

Simeon holds God's salvation in his arms. He holds God in his arms. This baby is the God of both Jews and Gentiles. 

Mary and Joseph, naturally, are bewildered about all the excitement over Jesus. Simeon blesses their family and tells Mary that this child is going to throw Israel into upheavel and will make many enemies who reveal their true motivations through their opposition to him. He tells her that a sword will pierce her own soul.

Mary and Joseph meet another prophet named Anna. She had been married once, but was widowed after only seven years. Luke tells us that she had not left the temple since her husband's death. Day and night, she fasted and prayed. When Anna saw the baby Jesus, she immediately began praising God. From there, she began telling faithful Jews about the child. These Jews were looking forward to, and fully expecting Jerusalem's redemption from her oppressors.

In all this, Joseph and Mary fulfilled their obligation to the laws of Moses and the Roman government. They returned to Nazereth, where Jesus grew up as children do. Luke tells us He was filled with wisdom and enjoyed the favour of his Father.

### Reflection

Jesus is just a baby in the second chapter of Luke. Though many are already celebrating his arrival, his ministry will not begin for another three decades. But even at the start of the story, we catch a glimpse of how it will end. Simeon knows the current world order is about to be shaken. The prophet Anna knows God will make good on his promise of freedom for the the Jews through this child. Amidst all the joy and worship, we know that Mary will not escape unscathed. Something will happen that will injure her very soul.

It's only Christmas, and already we're looking forward to Easter where the child redeemed by Mary and Joseph is sacrificed for the redemption of all people. Simeon and Anna obeyed God and were wise. But even then they probably had no idea of the freedom God has in mind. They knew Mary would grieve, but probably had no idea of the price God would pay to purchase our freedom.

Like the Passover for Israel, Christ's birth is a defining moment for our people. We celebrate it every year, and when our children ask what it means, we tell them that the Word became flesh. That to all who believe in Jesus, he gives power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God. We celebrate and give all glory to God and this unparalleled show of power. We look forward to Easter when we discover once and for all that God's promised redemption from death and sin is true.

## Colossians 3:12-17

Finally, in our epistle lesson, Paul declares the Colossian church to be _God's chosen ones_. They are beloved. They are set apart as holy. As such, they must seek to be characterized by compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. He says that if you have a complaint against someone, you must forgive as God has forgiven you. Above all, be characterized by love, which binds everything together. Let Christ's peace rule in your hearts and in your church and be thankful. Let Christ's Word live in you and grow. Teach and correct with wisdom, and worship God while giving thanks. Do and say everything in Christ's name, giving thanks to the Father through the Son.

### Reflection

Here, Paul declares the Colossians _God's chosen ones_. He also declares them _holy_. That is, set apart and dedicated for service to God. Though written to the Colossian church, God's message through Paul and through all Scripture is for Saint Peter's as well. We are God's chosen ones. As such, we are expected to live a certain way. While wisdom begins with fear of the Lord, fear need not compell us to _obey_ by acting a certain way. The Christian characteristics described by Paul are a natural result of letting Christ's word fill our lives. If we are not characterized by compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, we are not living like Christ. If we do not forgive, we are not obedient. How can Christ's peace rule in our hearts and in our church apart from love and living by these simple expectations? 

God's chosen people, the Israelites, were so quick to forget God's awesome power and immediate presence in their lives. As Christians, our freedom was purchased through God's sacrifice of his only son. Like the Colossians, we are God's chosen people. Let's not forget the meaning of Christ's birth. Let's not forget that we owe our freedom to God. Let's not forget that all we have, our health, our livelihood, our children, and our lives belong to God. God entered the world as a little baby and walked among his creation. Christ gave his life to redeem us. Give thanks and sing praise to God for this gift. Let everything you do bring glory to God. God's generosity to his chosen people is unparalleled. 

## Conclusion

You are God's chosen people. You know God's promises. You know they are true. You know that God purchased your lives. We celebrate holidays like Christmas in part so we don't forget what God has done. We celebrate so that our children will ask what it all means. God prepared our salvation in the presence of all people, but not all people know that they have a share in God's promises. It's our responsibility to deliver this Good News. As God's chosen, we are commanded to go into the world and make disciples. We are not given another option.

As part of the body of Christ, bound together in love, we are all called to contribute to this global effort in different ways. God paid an inconceivable price to redeem you. Ask Him how you are to worship and serve in light of his immeasurable generosity. As we see from Christ's own example, generosity is a powerful catalyst in redeeming lives. As a Wycliffe Bible Translator, I hear testimonies about how generosity changes individual lives and elevates entire civilizations. My mission to carry out God's command to bring the Good News of Christ depends on generosity. When you give, you give to God. You give glory and recognition that everything in your possession belongs to Him. When you give to my mission with Wycliffe, you are fulfilling your duty by acting in obedience to Christ's command to you.

At this moment, Wycliffe has an urgent need for Web developers. I have two future colleagues named Mark and Ray. They are computer programmers, but they know nothing about how to deliver software over the World Wide Web. By their own admission, they are in way over their heads. By God's provision, I have been teaching Web development for the last three years. My first assignment will be to teach Mark and Ray. In doing this, they will one day be able to replicate their skills in others. God has called me to this task. I cannot do my part until my full budget is proven sustainable.

I am asking you to ask God how much you should give in support of my ministry and in pursuit of Saint Peter's mission statement: _To be and make disciples for Jesus Christ_. God may say you are to sacrifice $200 a month, maybe $5 a month, or maybe even $0. Whatever it is, God will tell you what role you play in bringing Jesus to the world. You are God's chosen and you have a part in the Great Commission. Ask God and he will reveal it to you. Whatever your role, do it in Christ's name giving thanks. Be generous because God is generous with you.
