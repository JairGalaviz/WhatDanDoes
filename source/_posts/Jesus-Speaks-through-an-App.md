Lily, a translator in the Lentomi Bible translation project, was flying back to
her home country in Asia after attending a conference abroad. At the airport in
the capital city Lily’s mobile phone was inspected and officials discovered
that it contained an audio New Testament. Suspecting that Lily might be a
religious extremist, <!-- more --> they confiscated the phone and detained her
at the airport for questioning. The interrogation lasted two hours, as the
officers tried to make her incriminate herself. But Lily felt no fear as she
calmly answered all the questions.

At one point a group of officers were gathered around her, and one of them asked
to listen to her Scripture app. It ‘happened’ to be in the middle of the Sermon
on the Mount. When the head officer pushed the button, every­one present heard
the beginning of Matthew chapter 7 in their own language, which says:

> Do not judge others, and neither will you be judged. In the manner that you
> judge, likewise will judgement be passed on you.

Lily noticed one of the officers turn pale as he exclaimed ‘What did he say?!’
and he went on to retell in his own words what he had just heard. In response
Lily told him that it was true, we all reap what we sow.

On arriving home, Lily prepared the place for a possible search by removing the
Christian material that was there. At the same time a prominent local Christian
was advocating on Lily’s behalf, explaining to government officials that she
wasn’t some dangerous radical, and was not even a Muslim.

An email alert went out to hundreds of people around the world to pray for Lily.
One request was that she would be allowed to leave the country even while under
investigation. She was planning to attend an important training event in another
part of Asia later that month. Thankfully, she was able to depart and return
home without any complication.

Her home never was searched. About a month after her phone had been confiscated
Lily was called back to the airport. She was informed that nothing illegal had
been found on her phone and it was returned to her, with the audio New Testament
still there!
