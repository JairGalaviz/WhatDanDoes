## The Christmas Spirit

The birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is proof that God loves you<sup>[John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A16&version=NIV)</sup>. Remember this as you celebrate God's entry into the world as a <!-- more --> little baby this Christmas. Our God, our Creator swaddled and lovingly placed in a manger by his mother. Worship Jesus Christ and receive the Christmas Spirit. Know love, joy, peace, kindness, and all the goodness that comes with loving your neighbour and living your love for Christ.

I don't know that people talk much about the Christmas Spirit anymore. If you mention it, people will know what you mean, but may not agree about what the Christmas Spirit is. For those who celebrate Christmas as the birth of Jesus, it's safe to say the Christmas Spirit is Christ's own Holy Spirit. For those who celebrate the holidays in a different way, I couldn't say for sure... old movies give the impression that the Christmas Spirit is some vague notion of warm feelings radiating from deep inside the heart.

Whatever your notion of the Christmas holidays, this day has long been set aside to mark the birth of God's only son, Jesus Christ. He was born of the Virgin Mary to step-father Joseph in the town of Bethlehem. The Creator's word became flesh that day. He entered his own creation as a baby boy. The greatest story ever told starts at Christmas. The Christmas Spirit carries this story like music on the wind and brings deep hope and joy to those who know the story is true.

Share the story and receive the Christmas Spirit. Celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and become part of the story yourself. Let your spirit grow through the good stories people tell about you. The Christmas Spirit is the story of God the Father and how he gave us the only gift that matters, Jesus Christ his son. 

Of course, Jesus' birth isn't the only story we tell at Christmas. We all have our own stories. Some are happy. Some are sad. It can be hard to get into the Christmas Spirit when your own story is marked by sadness. But even a sad story can be a good one. This is the hope and joy that the Christmas Spirit brings. Live by the Spirit and a bad story becomes good.

Chapter 5 of Paul's letter to the Galatians says a lot about the Spirit and being oppressed by the Law. When we think Christmas, we don't usually think about the Laws of Moses. Neither do we think about the laws of Canada. It may come as a surprise that the Christmas Spirt, Christ's Holy Spirit, has anything to do with the law at all. 

## Galatians 5:1,13-26

<sup>1</sup> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

<sup>13</sup> You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. <sup>14</sup> For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” <sup>15</sup> If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.

<sup>16</sup> So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. <sup>17</sup> For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. <sup>18</sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

<sup>19</sup> The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup>20</sup> idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup>21</sup> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

<sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup>23</sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup>24</sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. <sup>25</sup> Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup>26</sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.

## Life by the Spirit

Paul's letter to the Galatians was written decades after Jesus left us his Holy Spirit. The Galatian church of the time was being led to believe that following Christ also meant submitting to the Law handed down through Moses. Paul wrote them a letter to explain that the Holy Spirit sets you free from this Law.

Paul opens Galatians 5 saying that Jesus Christ has set us free. He warns us to be careful and to not fall back into slavery to the Law. Use your freedom to build your community up in love. Don't use it to satisfy your own selfish desires. Live by the Spirit, be set free from the Law, and obey it all at the same time. The Law, after all, can be summed up in one command: _Love your neighbor as yourself_<sup>Gal 5:14</sup>. Take advantage of your neighbour, and you set the stage for a darker story.

If you live by the Holy Spirit, you won't have bad stories because you will be showing love to your neighbours. The Spirit makes you want to write a better story. He wants you to leave selfish things behind. The things that hurt ourselves and others. Your own desires are in constant battle with the Spirit. Though free from the Law, we easily fall back into submission to our own sinful nature. This stops us from doing the good things inspired by the Spirit. Align yourself with the Spirit, and be free from the Law God gave through Moses. Align yourself with the Spirit, and live without fear of the laws enforced by police here on earth.

Paul gives many examples of what it means to follow your own desires... the desires apart from the Holy Spirit. All manners of sexual immorality, witchcraft, hostility, greed, broken relationships, substance abuse, and other dangerous situations. Follow your desires apart from the Holy Spirit and the stories told of you will not be good. Let the Spirit guide you and find love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The Spirit sets you free from the Law because there are no laws against all these good things.

Living by the Spirit - belonging to Jesus - means nailing your sinful nature to the same cross upon which he died. Live by the Spirit and follow his lead. Stop being conceited, jealous, and hostile toward one another.

## Be a part of God's Story

In reading this passage and praying for God's message to Calgary, all the talk of the Spirit fit nicely with the season. By contrast, it may seem unusual to talk so much about the Law at Christmas. For some, the Law may even play a role in their own Christmas stories. When the law gets involved, someone got hurt. Maybe families were separated. It's hard to think of good stories when the Law gets involved.

In Galatians Paul tells us Moses' Law has no power when we live by the Spirit. The Law only has power over those living apart from the Spirit. Unlike the Spirit, the Law cannot set us free unless it imprisoned us in the first place. It cannot protect us, because the Law only shows up when there is a victim. The Law serves only to convict us of our crimes and determine how we are to be punished.

Though illegal under Moses' Law, many of the things Paul mentions aren't illegal under Canadian law. From stories we know that we often suffer anyway. There are few laws to govern sexual morality. There is no law against jealousy, anger, or selfish ambition. We try to write laws against hate, but people still hate. Same thing with drugs and alcohol. People still do foolish things while drunk and high. The law may not catch them, but they're punished every time the story is told about how someone got hurt.

Even in things we take for granted, bad stories abound at Christmas. What did Paul mean about _witchcraft_? This is Christmas, not Halloween! When it comes to witchcraft, there is certainly no Canadian law here. Santa makes Christmas magic every year when he gives gifts to all the good boys and girls. Santa is a bad story. If Santa doesn't come to your house this year, it's not because you are bad. The only power bad spirits like Santa have over us are the stories we tell about them. Santa wields great power over many lives with his magic. But the gifts he brings are worthless compared to the gift God gave us at Christmas, Jesus his son.

Those who have the Christmas Spirit know this: Jesus loves you whether you're good or bad. He entered our world in much the same way we all do, as a little baby. When he grew up, he told us good stories. He asks us to see if our stories are as good as his. He wants you to become part of his story this Christmas. His is the greatest story, and it will be told for eternity. 

For many, the Christmas holidays are marked by loss and sadness. For those living in the Spirit, these can still be good stories. Sad stories can still be about love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. All these things can be found in the story of Christ's birth, death, and resurrection. From the joy of a baby born in Bethlehem, to the rage and hatred of his adult enemies... his life free from sin, never once having broken the laws of God or man, brutally and unjustly executed as a criminal, to His resurrection and ascenscion into heaven, to the reality that he is coming back. 

Tell the story of Jesus birth and become part of the story. What better time than Christmas time to obey the Law and be set free all at the same time. It's easy to remember and brings so much joy: _Love your neighbor as yourself_. Lift up and encourage one another. Celebrate success together. Mourn loss together. Know the joy and peace that comes with gentleness and kindness. Live by the Spirit in faith and know the goodness that comes with patience, restraint, and love.

The gift God gave at Christmas is beyond comprehension. Contrary to what old movies say, the Christmas Spirit does not come from inside us. The Christmas Spirit is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is God. When we tell the story of Christmas, we are inviting the Holy Spirit into our lives. 

Live by the Spirit and become part of Christ's story. The Christmas Spirit is the deep-seated joy that comes from knowing that the story of the baby Jesus is true!

## Postlude

My name is Daniel Bidulock. I am a [Wycliffe Bible Translator](https://www.wycliffe.ca/). Learn more about my ministry at [whatdandoes.info](/).

Bible translation requires literacy. Literacy results in education, equality, and economy. But most important of all, Bible translation brings Christmas to people who have never heard the name of Jesus. It writes new stories in history.

Reading, hearing, viewing God's Word in your own language for the first time can be life changing. A whole new world opens up to reveal Christ's message of Salvation and His promise of eternal life with Him. The celebration of Christ's birth comes alive and offers hope, faith and love to all who are willing to receive the Gift. Stories of people encountering God's Word in their own language shows best the power of the Holy Spirit reaching out through Scriptures to change lives.

My work as a Bible transator is supported by generous people like you. I cannot do my work without your generosity. Go to whatdandoes.info and ask God about joining me and Wycliffe in prayer and financial partnership. We are not concerned with the amount you are called to give. God may tell you to pledge $200 per month, or he may tell you to pledge $5 per month. All generosity is celebrated, no matter the amount. And all generosity has a direct impact on bringing hope and improving lives all around the world. 

Bible translation is foundational to carrying out the mission Christ gave to all his followers: _go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit_. Visit whatdandoes.info. Contact me, Dan Bidulock, through my website whatdandoes.info. Ask God if you can take this opportunity to be blessed. Sow generously and reap a generous reward.

Thank you to Bart, John, and Marilyn for your help in preparing this message. Thank you to my generous supporters... friends, family, kind strangers. You have enabled me to do God's work full time. Blessings to [Saint Peter's Lutheran Church in Cochrane](http://www.saintpeters.ca/) and to all God's people in Calgary, and beyond.

May God show you how to take the path of joy and peace. Let go of past wrongs. Embrace the way of love, forgiveness, and grace. Be written into the good story. May you live in peace. 

Merry Christmas, 2018!
