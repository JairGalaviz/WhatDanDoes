# Saint Peter's Lutheran - Twelfth Sunday after Pentecost

God excuses you.

## 1 Kings 19:1â€“8

There's a lot leading into today's Old Testament passage. In a nutshell, Queen Jezebel swears by her gods that she is going to kill Elijah, and Elijah, in response, flees for his life. His fear, though understandable, is completely uncharacteristic. To understand why, we need to know how Elijah found himself in this situation.

Elijah has been in exile for years. At God's command, he returned to a drought-stricken Israel with an audacious challenge for the prophets on Queen Jezebel's payroll. Under King Ahab's direction, 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah are called to rise to Elijah's challenge. These prophets and Elijah are to each prepare a sacrifice. Each side will call upon their God or gods. The sacrifice that is consumed by fire sent from heaven will prove which god is the one true God.

Jezebel's prophets prepare their sacrifice and work themselves into a self-mutilating frenzy, imploring their gods to send down their unholy fire. They do this from morning until afternoon. All the while Elijah stands by mocking them. The Baals do not answer. They send no fire. 

Elijah then prepares his own sacrifice in the manner prescribed by God. He calls upon the Israelites gathered there to witness the event. He tells them to douse the altar, the bull, and wood with 12 jars of water. There's enough water to fill a trench around the 12-stone altar he's constructed there.

Elijah prays and then, to everyone's terror, the entire altar - the wood, stones, bull, water, and the dust itself - are consumed by God's fire in such a dramatic fashion that all Israel immediately repents of their sins. Then, under Elijah's direction, they capture the prophets of Baal and execute them down by the river.

And with that, another prayer, and a warning to Ahab, the drought that had crippled Israel abruptly ends with heavy rain. Ahab rushes back home in his chariot only to find Elijah, who had traveled on foot, waiting for him at the gate. 

This is where today's Old Testament lesson begins...

Ahab tells Jezebel what had happened to her prophets. Enraged, she invites a curse upon herself swearing that her gods should take her life, if she hasn't murdered Elijah by this time tomorrow.

Fearing for his life, Elijah heads south to Judah where he parts ways with his servant, and then walks alone for a day out into the wilderness. He ends up under a tree feeling worthless. He tells God that he can't take anymore of this. He believes himself no better than his own wicked ancestors. He asks God that he may die, and then falls asleep.

Some time later he wakes up and finds an angel poking him. The angel has brought him water and baked some bread on hot stones. Elijah drinks, eats, and then falls back asleep. Again the angel comes back, pokes him, and says you better have more to eat, because you're going on a journey.

Elijah walks 40 days on the sustenance provided by those two meals. He arrives at a cave in Mount Horeb and spends the night.

And so ends the lesson...

#### Reflections

Today's reading is a tiny peek at a much wider drama. We always assume the worst of Ahab and Jezebel, but here we see Elijah in a uncharacteristic moment of fear, weakness, and self pity.

Bear in mind all that led up to Jezebel making her threat against Elijah's life. He put everything on the line in front of King Ahab, Jezebel's prophets, and the nation of Israel. He challenged the prophets with what he knew to be an impossible task for them. He had every confidence that God would demonstrate his power and firmly establish Elijah as his prophet. 

In all that, Elijah never expressed doubt or feared the consequences should he fail to call down fire from heaven. There was no hint of the sudden self-pity we witness in this passage. Even though, in all likelihood, he would either have been stoned to death by the people, or executed some other way under Ahab's orders. Incredibly, Elijah wasn't afraid then.

He also wasn't afraid when he ordered the capture and execution of Baal's prophets. He could easily have been killed in the ensuing mayhem. He could easily have been killed under Ahab's orders. Thank God Ahab seems indifferent to the slaughter of the false prophets.

Why now, is Elijah afraid of Jezebel? 

At her threat, he flees for his life out into the wilderness alone. Filled with shame, he asks God that he may die. He receives an answer in the form of an angel, who gives him food and sends him on a long walk. We would assume that this gives him plenty of time to fast, reflect, and pray.

Incredibly, this is where the OT lesson ends. We are left with this question unanswered: _Why is Elijah afraid of Jezebel?_  We continue reading past where today ends and we find out that God has a question of his own. Having spent the night in a cave at Mount Horeb, God asks him, 

_What are you doing here, Elijah?_

In all that time spent walking to Mount Horeb, 

In response, Elijah proclaims his zealousness for the Lord, and laments Israel's sin. He proclaims himself to be the lone prophet left in Israel (which he knows isn't true from his encounter with Obadiah in _1 Kings 18:4_), and then he says that he is afraid for his life.

And then, on Mount Horeb with God, Elijah witnesses a show of supernatural force involving wind, earthquake, and fire, expecting God to pass by. God does not make himself known in any of these great shows of power, but in the silence, when he asks Elijah again...

_What are you doing here?_

The Bible records God's question to Elijah two times. Likewise, Elijah's statement of zealousness, disappointment, and fear is recorded twice. Both times Elijah's response makes no sense. In the last couple of months, Elijah performed a miracle sacrifice, witnessed Israel's repentance, slaughtered a small town's worth of false prophets, and put an end to many years of drought. given what's happened in the last couple of months of miracle sacrifices, Israel's repentance, the slaughter of the false prophets, and the end of many years of drought. Truly a successful time in Elijah's career as a prophet. Clearly, the time to be afraid had long passed.

Elijah's attitude does not reflect reality and God gives his complaint no direct response. Instead, he orders Elijah to go back the way he came in order to crown two new kings and anoint a new prophet of God.

Truly, only God knows why Elijah had fled. And truly, God knows what is in Elijah's heart. Someone so zealous and righteous traded his fear of God for fear of Jezebel. Elijah, though among God's greatest prophets, is revealed to be human like the rest of us. And God reveals himself to be patient. He also reveals his deep love for Elijah in how he eventually relieves him of his earthly duties... further we see God's compassion and mercy.

Though it is baffling given all that had happened, Elijah was not wrong to be afraid. His error was in failing to turn to God and trusting His purpose for Elijah's life. Instead, he took his life into his own hands, and fled without consulting the only one who can truly help him. In this way, I know many of us can relate to Elijah. Knowing that he is someone just like the rest of us, demands empathy for a man scarred by the things he's seen, whether it be Israel's general depravity or the violence commanded of him by God. 

#### Conclusion

Fear was Elijah's excuse. It wasn't a good one. He points to the forsaken covenant, the broken altars, and murdered prophets of God. Not once giving thanks or praise for God's recent demonstration of unparalleled power. In his 40 day journey of fasting, Elijah came to value his life once again, but still had no answer for this simple question:

_What are you doing here?_

_What am I doing here?_  for that matter.

We really see Elijah at his worst here. Understandably, perhaps, given the terrible acts of violence he's orchestrated, whether righteous or not. Again, more speculation, because I'm sure many of us know someone whose story is directed by war, or even worse violence. May God's assurances of righteousness heal the scars on his heart and mind.

Elijah's response to God's question, reveals a lot about him... why is he on Mount Horeb?

1. He didn't fear God.

He was afraid of Jezebel.

2. He didn't turn to God.

He turned and fled for his life.

3. He didn't ask God.
  
 Not only did he fail to do this when faced with Jezebel's very real threat, he failed to do this on Mount Horeb. We kind of discover what he really wants when he first flees in the wilderness and prays under the broom tree...

Elijah is tired. He doesn't want to do this anymore.
 
It's easy to get swept up in Elijah's weakness, and to make comparisions between ourselves and the excuses we give God when he asks us to do something. This is not wrong. Scripture is a mirror that reflects different lives. Measuring your own life, mind, and heart against the stories of the lives there in, is a search for Godly wisdom. May this kind of self reflection further reflect God's glory off of you.

But then again, it's not about you. The Scriptures are about God. Let's take this opportunity to extol God's patience, compassion, and mercy

Elijah did plenty wrong in this passage. How did God respond?

1. He didn't fear God

God responded with patience.

2. He didn't turn to God

God came to him! Well, he sent him an angel. Gave him food, water, and plenty of time for self reflection.

3. He didn't ask God

And still God eventually gave him what he wanted and more.

Taken at sincere face value, Elijah is tired of being a prophet. He doesn't want to do it anymore. And yes, even though it doesn't make sense, I believe Elijah is afraid for his life. He doesn't want to die. 

At first glance, it kind of seems like God ignores Elijah's response when he asks him what he's doing on Mount Horeb. Of course, he doesn't. The incredible mercy, compassion, and patience God shows Elijah is capped off by one incredible event where Elijah is carried off into heaven on a chariot of fire, having annointed Elisha his successor. Afraid for his life, Elijah escapes death. Truly a great honour and a fitting end for a worthy warrior and prophet.

I have no doubt that God loves me, just like he loves Elijah. I have no doubt that God loves you as much as he loves Elijah. Though we all have our human weaknesses, it's really only in God's love that we share anything with this great prophet. His zealousness and obedience to God far surpasses mine.

I read four chapters of the Bible every day. This allows enough time for one pass of the OT and two passes of the NT every year. I like Scripture best when I know the names of the people in the stories. At my best, most focused study, I have to necessarily make assumptions about motivations. Naturally, I have to draw from my internal well of personal motivations, so when understanding the story from the people as you perceive them, you hold up a mirror to yourself.

But again, it's not about me, it's not about you, it's not about Elijah. It's about God. It's about patience, compassion, mercy, and all the things that make God glorious.

_What am I doing here?_

- I'm too weak
- I'm too young
- I'm too old
- I'm not smart enough
- I'm too sick
- I'm too poor

We all have our excuses, but only God can excuse us. May God be so merciful with each of us. Let Scripture reflect upon us, so that we too can extol God's virtues.
