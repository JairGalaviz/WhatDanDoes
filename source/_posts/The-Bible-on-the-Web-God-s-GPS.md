#### _With the prevalence of web technologies, it's hard to remember a time when a story like this would have been science fiction._

On our way back from the airport, when our Ethiopian taxi driver learned that
we work in Bible translation, he exclaimed, “I’ve often wondered if the Bible
was in my mother tongue of Tigrinya.”

Upon hearing this, I pulled out my cell-phone and within a minute found an
audio recording and script of the Tigrinya New Testament on
[Scripture Earth](https://scriptureearth.org), a website that contains
translations of Scripture in many languages of the world.

We wish you could have seen the joy on his face as he heard God’s Word in his
language for the first time! He then excitedly pointed to the GPS in his car
and said, “The Bible is every person’s GPS to God!”

Showing someone how to connect with online Scriptures in their mother tongue
is a great way to introduce them to Christ!
