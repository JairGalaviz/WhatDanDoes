# Saint Peter's Lutheran - Eleventh Sunday after Pentecost

Today's lessons from Exodus, Ephesians, John, and the Psalms provide a rich pool of Biblical illustrations from which to draw.

## Exodus 16:2–15

In the Exodus verse, we find the escaped Israelite slaves starving to death in the desert. Naturally, the entire nation is upset with Aaron and Moses. They start getting all nostalgic about their time in Egypt...

Everyone is in a tough spot. Whatever food they do have is insufficient. The reality for this newly-liberated, incipient Israelite nation is that their current situation is unsustainable. In addition to this ubiquitous problem, Moses and Aaron's situation is complicated by the fact that everyone is pointing the finger at them for their predicament.

Thankfully, God wants to test the Israelites' obedience to him, so he steps in with instructions for Moses. Him and Aaron first warn the Israelites. They say,  _You guys better watch out... you blame us for this situation, but you're really blaming God!_ This point is stressed a second time after they deliver the good news that God is sending help: _there'll be meat tonight, and then tomorrow, there'll be bread for breakfast_.

Even with God's presence in the cloud as Aaron relays Moses' message,  it's easy to imagine the angry Israelites dispersing and biding their time until evening, when they'll lynch Moses and Aaron, and bug out back to Egypt.

Of course, that doesn't happen... thousands of quail drop into the camp that evening. And, as promised, the next morning the Israelites are introduced to _manna_, which is the miraculous _bread_ that sustains them for at least four decades until they're finally established in the promised land.

The manna, is central to God's obedience test for the Israelites. He gives explicit instructions on how this never-seen-before food source is to be managed... the rule basically boils down to this: the Israelites must not keep leftovers. The only exception to this rule is when preparing for the Sabbath. In that case, they are to gather twice as much and eat half of it on God's day of rest, because no manna will materialize.

Manna is a generous, miraculous provision, with few strings attached.

### Reflection

Simple rules, and a relatively easy test of obedience when contrasted with God's test for Abraham, where he was told to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Praise God for his **abundant mercy**, because many Israelites immediately disobeyed.

This verse is multifaceted. It would be easy to talk about the Israelites _grumbling_ against Aaron and Moses. They aren't happy, and it makes sense that God is sympathetic. He is not an unreasonable God. He knows not everyone in the Israelite camp is as faithful as the other.  I'm looking at the verse describing the event and I see little evidence of any specific sin in their grumbling...

We could make much of this _grumbling_, but the Israelites are not unreasonable in their concern and discontent. Moses and Aaron are likewise completely reasonable in deflecting the blame being directed at themselves. _Who are they?_ after all. Even Moses was known to grumble from time to time (Num 11:10-15). Everyone is grumbling and God is listening. On the flip side, God obviously knows Israel _is not_ listening to him. He listens to their grumbling, but they don't listen to him. He tests them on it, perhaps to prove a point.

He provides Israel with bread and meat with only light strings attached... He says, _follow these rules about the manna I give you and enjoy_. Break the rules, you stink up the place, and Moses comes around grumbling at you! Barely a consequence when you compare to the other time God sent quail and struck them with a plague because some of them were greedy. See Numbers 11:31-35.

God has **abundant patience** for grumbling, it seems. Manna was a generous and miraculous provision from God. It was tailor-made to force you into obedience. Disobedience which only resulted in a slap on the wrist.

### Conclusion

God, through Moses, led the entire Israelite nation out of Egypt. Called in this way, it is not unreasonable to expect God to provide. We do not have an unreasonable God. 

## John 6:22–35

In John, Jesus has just fed 5,000 men (and uncounted women and children) with only a few small fish and a few small loaves of bread. People are obviously thrilled by this and are bent on making him their king. Instead Jesus takes off into the mountains to be alone. The disciples, likewise, leave the area by boat.

The crowd realizes Jesus is gone. They're literally seeking Jesus. They know Jesus wasn't on the boat when the disciples left. So whoever in the crowd are able, boards boats of their own and eventually find Jesus in Capernaum. This obviously doesn't make sense, because he would have had to cross the sea somehow (he did, of course, in the previous passage). The crowd knows nothing of this miracle, so they ask him how he got there. He ignores the question.

Jesus understands that these people come looking for earthly food. They're concern is for the temporal, which Jesus says is a waste of time. He tells them that the food for which they labour will perish. They came all this way, looking to satisfy their material needs. Christ can effortlessly meet these needs. He explains that it is far better to labour for that which is eternal and won't perish.

Those gathered are curious. They ask Jesus how they can do God's work. Jesus tells them to _believe in the one who He sent_. That is, if you believe Jesus, he will provide you with eternal rewards

Incredibly, those gathered request a sign like that they say was performed by Moses when he gave them manna in the desert. This affirms Christ's initial observation when the crowd first found him in Capernaum... that they came seeking after earthly matters and didn't even see the signs he'd already performed.

Equally incredibly, while their ancestors grumbled against Moses and blamed him for their predicament, now they credit him with providing their ancestors with food. Christ corrects them. The manna came from God, his Father.  _True bread that comes down from Heaven_.

Those gathered want this bread. So Christ says that he is the true bread. That he will nourish you like manna. Just believe in him.

Three passages later in the same chapter, most of Christ's disciples abandon him thinking he'd gone out of his mind suggesting that he himself is bread to be consumed. Bizarre. He asks The Twelve if they're going to leave too. They say, _where else are we going to go? You're the truth_. They believed him.

### Reflections

Is _belief_ also _obedience_. The two are substantially different, for certainly you can easily obey but not believe. Believing in Jesus comes with the expectation of obedience. Jesus provides for those who do his work. If he calls you to a task, he will nourish you in a temporal way. Here on earth, he provides.

My own life and family testify to this fact... and also to the fact that I believe Jesus and still disobey all the time. God's been patient with me, and only God knows why.

Christians work for that which is imperishable. Labouring and supporting God's work in any capacity is a great privilege. Those called to do so can likewise expect God's provision. Investing your time, talent, and money in obedience to God is an investment that is rewarded in heaven and on earth.

Christ says, _just believe the one the Father sent_. He is bread from heaven. He is master of **limitless abundance**, as evidenced in these lessons here today. Perishable manna and bread in abundance... (no left overs). Meeting our material needs is effortless for Christ. Believe in him. Labour for what is imperishable for there is no end to what is perishable.

### Conclusion

Invest what you have and see how God blesses you. Take every opportunity to be blessed.

## Psalm 145:14-16,21

From today's Psalm:

> The  Lord  sustains all who fall  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  raises up all who are bowed down.
> The eyes of all look to you,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you give them their food in due season.
> You open your hand;
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you satisfy the desire of every living thing.

And then verse 21:

>   My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.

### Reflections

**Abundant mercy and grace**. Just like when Israel disobeyed with the manna. The repercussions were light. God provides for those who obey.

## Ephesians 4:1–16

In the fourth chapter of Paul's letter to the Ephesians, Paul encourages the church to seek unity in the Spirit while imprisoned in Rome. He in fact, describes himself as a _Prisoner of the Lord_, or _Prisoner for the Lord_ depending upon the translation. This echos Moses' cautions about grumbling against the Lord, in that it states a simple fact, Paul is in prison because God wants him there.

Paul testifies to Christ's measured, but **abundant grace**. How in His death, resurrection, and ascension he freed and took captives, and left gifts for the people left behind. The gifts noted here pertain to professional ministry roles in the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers who, in turn, _equip the saints for the work of service, the building up of the body of Christ;_ 

Or as Paul says in 4:13, we are to persist in building Christ's body _until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ_.

All that to say, everyone must know about Christ. All Christians are to work together in pursuing this, and pursuing ever deeper understanding and wisdom. We do this by building churches and expressing simple truth with love to fellow brothers and sisters. This establishes unity and guards against malicious forces and doctrine that would otherwise distract us and potentially erode our faith. The healthy body, working in harmony, grows naturally from the **abundant love** that emanates from within.

#### Reflections

Christ's church body is a celebration of self-replicating diversity. It is much like the marriage between a man and a woman where we build up our families with love. We are all called to serve the church and grow our family.

Paul makes special mention of those called to serve the church exclusively. This is but one example of essential diversity and certainly among the _works of God_ described by Christ in John.  It was Christ himself who left gifts behind for his people. We are all called to service and we are all gifted in some way.

Obeying Paul's instructions to the Ephesians is obeying God. We work for what is imperishable when we build our church. Not everyone is called to professional ministry, but we are all called.

What does this mean?

It means you need to know how you are called. If you know, then God bless you. Ask others to pray for your specific ministry as you carry out your duties. Come ask me! I'll join you in prayer.

If you don't know how you're called, take your question to God... he's got something for you. He will definitely reveal to you how to take what he has given you, and invest it in the eternal. Ask God, what you have to give, and then obey! Then see what abundance he has in store for you... be it grace, love, mercy, or bread from heaven.

It is a privilege to serve Christ as a vocational calling. We are put here like Christ put Paul in prison. It is is a joy to be a prisoner for Christ. I am obeying God in pursuing my call to serve the Wycliffe Bible Translators of Canada... there is simply no other way to obey God without delivering Scripture to every single one of God's children in a way that truly speaks to their heart. People doing this exact work are responsible in bringing me to Christ.
