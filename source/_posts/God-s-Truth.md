God's Truth

Where do you find it?

How do you know?

## Deuteronomy 4:1–2, 6–9

In today's Old Testament lesson we find Moses preaching a sermon on the law, obedience, and the fear of God to the nation of Israel. Up until this point, Israel had been wandering in the desert waiting for their older generation to die off. They had disobeyed God forty years earlier and this is their punishment. Though God had promised a successful invasion of the land of Canaan, they were too afraid. As a result, this old generation were not allowed to enter the promised land.

Moses too, had been denied entry for his own disobedience and is now teaching God's Law at God's command. He reminds Israel that these laws are just and fair... that if Israel is careful to obey, they will live, and the entire land of Canaan will be theirs. He points to historical events that demonstrate the **truth** of the words he is speaking. About how God had eradicated those among them who worshiped idols. How the people standing before Moses today are survivors and witnesses to that event. They are alive because they obeyed the Lord.

Much of the law Moses is teaching today is the same law that applied in the desert, with a few additions. It will now also apply when they are settled in their new territory. The surrounding nations will witness their obedience and recognize that Israel's God is unlike their own gods, and that His law is unlike any other. It is just. It brings glory to the nation of Israel and, most importantly, to God himself.

The lesson closes with Moses' warning to Israel... remember all that you've seen. Don't let a day go by without recalling these memories. Tell everything you've seen to your children and all your children's children. This is something that must never be forgotten throughout all the generations.

### Reflection

The Book of Deuteronomy provides a _second reading_ of what we often call the Mosaic Laws. The Israelites had come a long way since their escape from Egypt. Set free from their slavery, God promised them a successful invasion of the land of Canaan... a permanent homeland. Of course, this earlier generation initially rejected this promise, and were forced to wander the desert for 40 years.

Deuteronomy recounts some of this history and calls the nation to reaffirm their covenant with God... that is, if they obey, they will be blessed. If they don't, they will be punished. Deuteronomy has much to tell us about the law and God's promises... God's blessings and curses. 

Moses is very much preaching to the choir in this situation. Those present today are only alive because they were obedient. They witnessed for themselves all the ways that God had blessed them throughout their journey (water, manna, quail, military victory). They also witnessed what happens to those who disobey. See Number 25:9 where 24,000 people died of a plague sent by God.

Deuteronomy ends with Moses blessing the nation, installing Joshua as his successor, and the obedient Israelites preparing to launch their invasion of Canaan. Though God shows Moses the promised land, he never sets foot in it. Moses dies and is buried, and the Bible says there has been no other prophet like him.

Israel knows the **truth**, they'd seen God's work in their lives, and they are ready to seek God's will for his chosen people, trusting in his promises, and always singing his praises so that God's might will always be remembered.

After that it was smooth sailing for the Jews, right?

## Mark 7: 1-8, 14-15, 21-23

Centuries later we find Jesus ministry flourishing. It's so successful that members of the dominant Jewish sect and scribes are showing up to hear him teach. They see Christ's students washing with _defiled_ hands. It had long been held as tradition that hands, food, and pots and pans be cleansed as taught to them by their elders. They ask Jesus why some of his disciples aren't obeying these instructions.

In response, Jesus calls them _hypocrites_ and cites Isaiah: _You're saying that your law is God's law_. That they are abandoning God's commands, in favour of general rules intended to regulate behavior or thought... this is a _precept_, as in Mark 7:7.

Jesus then expounds upon the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. They nullify God's commands with their own traditions. Honor your father and mother. Don't speak ill of your father and mother, or you will die. Instead the Pharisees teach that you can nullify your obligation to your mother and father if you give the money to the church instead. In doing this, they don't even allow their followers to do anything their parents. The obligation is to their law, not to your parents. This is just one many wicked laws.

Jesus calls to the crowd again. He says: _there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile._

Jesus and his disciples leave the crowd. The disciples don't understand what he means about eating and the very real, very human _digestive_ process. These are the terms in which they are understanding his words to the crowd. As always, Jesus knows what they're thinking and clarifies: _It's not about what goes out into the sewer that makes you unclean_. Food, though a critical part of life, may certainly impact your body, but it does not taint your _heart_. Food goes into your stomach, is digested, and expelled. There's nothing wrong with that! Rather, it's what comes from your heart that defiles you... fornication, theft, murder, adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly... all evil intentions come from within a person. This is what defiles us.

### Reflection

It's easy to assume that the Pharisee's questions concerning hand-washing are meant to be accusatory, or even derogatory. They say, _Look at these animals! Jesus sure hangs around some scuzzy people._ More so, by calling into question the worthiness of Christ's followers, they undermine his teaching. Jesus' sharp words in response, show he did not appreciate what they were saying about his followers. 

We've been here before... Jesus first draws the ire of the Pharisees in Mark 2 where he dines with tax collectors and picks wheat on the Sabbath. Then there's another Sabbath violation when Jesus heals a man's hand in Chapter 3. From there the Pharisees start actively conspiring against Jesus with the Herodians.

Whatever their motivations in questioning, clearly Jesus is angry with the Pharisees. He holds up Scripture as a **mirror** and calls them out on their abusive traditions. In defense of his _scuzzy_ followers, Jesus tells them that nothing that goes into your body will defile you. It's what comes out. 

Somehow, in teaching their children the traditions of the elders, the Pharisees have talked their way out of any true obedience to God's commandments. Surely they know the God's commandments and the Mosaic Law, though somehow their precepts have superseded sound doctrine, that is God's **truth**. Their hearts are far from God. What comes from their hearts is ample evidence that their traditions do nothing to make them acceptable to God. As in the verse from Isaiah, their worship is pointless.

## James 1:17-25

The Epistle of James opens with a greeting to Jews spread out over the world. He encourages believers to face their trials with joy, because difficulty builds enduring faith. He tells them to ask God for wisdom with the expectation of a share in his limitless provision. Do this with faith that God will deliver, or you will receive nothing.

The epistle's author, who was traditionally thought to be James the brother of Jesus, prays that those believers with no wealth or status - those who are lowly - will boast in being raised up, and for the rich to likewise boast in being humbled. The trappings of wealth, after all, can afford many fruitless distractions to sap the life from the rich.

James then says anyone who has endured temptation is blessed and will receive what God has promised us... he calls it the _crown of life_. Withstand the test and be blessed... and know that temptation _does not_ come from God. Temptation arises from our own desires. Follow your desires and you will die.

Here's where today's epistle lesson begins...

James starts by describing something truly miraculous. He speaks to giving and receiving. Every gift comes from God. As such, every gift given is given to God. With God, you can expect permanence. The Father of light, as James calls him, casts no shadow of uncertainty. He gives believers birth through **truth** with the expectation of productivity... that we would be a kind of first fruits from among his creatures.

As children of the word that gives us life, we are instructed to be cautious in our approach to others. Listen carefully, choose your words wisely, and don't succumb to anger. Your anger does not produce God's righteousness. James then tells us to rid ourselves of the sordidness that leads to temptation, sin, and death. Rather submit to God through the word implanted in us. This word has the power to save our souls.

James then tells us that we must be doers of the word. If you think you can just sit back and listen to the word, you are fooling yourselves. Those who hear and don't _do_ look at themselves in the **mirror** and forget what they look like as soon as they walk away. _Doing_ means looking into God's law, the law that gives us freedom. Do this, persevere, and be blessed.

The chapter closes with a warning for those who want to appear religious. They speak carelessly and deceive themselves. Their religion is worthless. Godly religion is characterized by caring for orphans and widows and guarding yourself against worldly corruption.

### Reflection

Reading James, I get the impression that there were some Pharisees still causing trouble... or, if not actual Pharisees, certainly those who similarly paid lip service to God's **truth**, without  _doing_ God's **truth**. On the flip side, James' Epistle has proven controversial over the centuries, because of his insistence on _doing_.

Though having long been accepted as Scripture, James raises issues concerning justification through faith alone. How can James say you must do good works, otherwise your faith is dead? The idea that a believer could be barred from heaven because of insufficient human effort flies in the face of what we know about God and our own sinful nature. Our hope is in Christ's work, not our own. Disagreements over how are sins are pardoned highlight one of the main differences between the various flavours of Catholicism and churches born of the reformation.

Controversy aside, James is preaching God's **truth**, and I'll be the last person to tell you that any Scripture means something different than what it says. God help me speak only God's **truth** and **truth** about God. James speaks truth about God and how **truth** about ourselves is revealed when we hold up Scripture as our **mirror**. 

I hold up James as a **mirror** to myself. Do his words upset me? It doesn't matter, because I've got good news... I'm _doing_ God's word. I do it, I pray for wisdom, and I know that God will deliver!

Reflect on your place in God's story, and be blessed. James warns against hearing the word without pause to reflect. Hearing the word, holding up Scripture as a **mirror**, and not contemplating what is reflected back, bears no fruit. Hearing but not doing results in you forgetting what you look like to God and failing to better reflect his glory. You deny yourself the opportunity to give, bless others, and be blessed in return.

In saying that we must be _doers_ of the word, James isn't holding you up to human scrutiny like with the Pharisees and their traditions. He's not even saying to invite God's scrutiny. God already knows all about you and the state of your heart. Rather, he's pointing you to a more reflective surface for when you need to scrutinize yourself. That surface, God's perfect law of liberty doesn't regulate, it sets you free to bless more and to be blessed more.

## Conclusion

God's truth... where do you find it? How do you know?

The ancient Israelites were blessed with Moses, a prophet like no other, and many still didn't believe God's truth. Submit to God's will, as prescribed by law, and be blessed. Fail to do so, you die. For a time in Israel's history, everyone believed God's promises. The truth was delivered by Moses. They knew the truth because of what they had seen.

Christ's first followers were blessed having witnessed God himself, the word made flesh. Like the Israelites, his followers knew the truth because of what they saw, and what Christ taught them. He measured the Pharisees by the Scripture, and they came up wanting. The traditions handed down to them had overridden and subdued God's law in their lives.

Christ knew the truth. He told the truth, and he told us how to test it for ourselves. So often times we find ourselves in a place of uncertainty. Worldly wisdom dictates that we follow our hearts. Christ's truth suggests the opposite... evil sprouts from the heart. The Pharisees laws do nothing to cleanse the heart. Only the truth itself can cleanse the heart, and as sinners, that doesn't come from within. It can only come from God. He held up Scripture as a mirror and revealed the hearts of the Pharisees.

James speaks God's truth. God is answers prayers. God is generous to those who seek his wisdom. God does not tempt. God is constant. God gives us life through the words of truth. It that truth doesn't change me, take deeper root in my corrupt heart, then what good are my efforts?

James points to a person's mild manner, thoughtful words, and service to widows and orphans as a practical demonstration of how _doing_ the word manifests. Scripture is a mirror that reflects different lives. Measuring your own life, mind, and heart against the stories of the lives there in, is a search for Godly wisdom. May this kind of self reflection further reflect God's glory off of you. Let the law of liberty set you free to seek God's blessing upon your lives. As James says, all acts of generous giving come from God. When you give, you give to God. God's promise is that he gives back. To know this is **truth**, you have to _do_ it and see for yourself, knowing that God is sovereign over all creation and that his blessings are limitless.

Everyone must know this, but there are still people in the world today who have no **mirror**. They do not even have one verse in a language they can understand. 

Scripture changed my story. Memories fade, but I can still point to people in my life today who will say they knew a different _Dan_. They'll tell you it all started when I became a Christian. I tell you it all started when I began collecting comic book Bible tracts at the bus stop.

All of a sudden, God's voice called to me from every story I heard - especially in movies, music, and TV. God showed me the truth and fifteen years later I am a Wycliffe Bible Translator and Computer Scientist carrying out the Great Commission.

My story is one of billions. Bible translation changes the stories of entire civilizations. In practical terms: equality, education, economy, and eternity. In carrying out my mission, I bring an opportunity to be blessed and to become part of this story. This is a story that will be told for eternity.

I'll close with a verse from Psalm 51:

**Glory be to the Father and to the Son****and to the Holy Spirit;****as it was in the beginning,****is now, and will be forever. Amen.**
