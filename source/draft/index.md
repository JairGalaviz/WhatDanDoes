There are over 7000 languages spoken in the world today. Of these, over 2000 have not a single verse of Scripture. Many of these languages can't even be written down. This can be changed, and you can help change it.

Those who partner with Wycliffe Bible Translators enable access to the basic tools of literacy in the 21st century. From physical and on-screen keyboards to story-telling applications that allow minority language groups to record old stories, write new ones, and teach others to express themselves with their own written word.

My name is Daniel Bidulock, Web Developer and Wycliffe Bible Translator. When I reach full support I am to join in developing a Web application for coordinating efforts between native speakers and Bible translators. Software like this is a valuable tool in modern translation projects. Tools like these make Bible translation faster, easier, and cheaper.

I need your help to get started. The money you invest in this project will change lives. You will enable minority language groups to preserve their culture and hear Christ's Good News for the first time in the language of their hearts.

Bible translation changes lives. Literacy changes lives. All of this is enabled by your generosity. Honor God with your sacrifices and stake your claim in fulfilling Christ's Great Commission.

_Alternates:_

- My name is Daniel Bidulock and I'm coming to visit your congregation. Please pray and ask God if you are called to join me and Wycliffe in this work.
- My name is Daniel Bidulock. When enabled by your generosity, I will be able to apply my skills in delivering Christs Good News.

Go to my website at whatdandoes.info to donate through Wycliffe or through Patreon where a small sacrifice becomes so much more. For as little as five dollars a month, you give the gift of education, economy, equality, and a good story in eternity.
